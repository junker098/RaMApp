A small iOS application with two screens that interacts with the Rick and Morty API.

Mandatory Requirements:
	1.	Minimum deployment target: iOS 15.0.

	4.	Use URLSession to interact with the API.

Optional but Bonus Requirements:
	1.	Use TCA/Redux or a similar architecture.
	2.	Use dependencies (e.g., using the Swift Dependencies library).
	3.	Use the Coordinator pattern.
	4.	Implement pagination when loading the character list.
	5.	Use a library for image loading and caching, such as Nuke.
